# Customer Analytics - Theme Park Review Analysis

## Project Overview

Customer Analytics is a company that specializes in gathering and deriving insights from data collected across various social channels to support business decisions. As data analysts at Customer Analytics, we have been tasked with analyzing a large dataset of customer reviews for a theme park company with three major branches located in California, Paris, and Hong Kong. The dataset consists of 35,000 customer reviews, which is accessible via Cloud Deakin.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to use Python and Jupyter Notebook on the Google Colab platform to process, explore, and analyze the provided data. The aim is to generate insights and provide answers to specific questions of interest regarding customer behavior and sentiments across the three theme park branches.

## Questions of Interest

### A. Visitor Groups Analysis
- **Task**: Identify and compare the top 10 groups of visitors at each theme park branch based on their location of origin.
- **Objective**: Determine if there are differences in the top visitor groups among the branches and analyze the reasons behind such differences.

### B. Peak Visiting Times Analysis
- **Task**: Compare the peak visiting times at the California branch for both domestic and international visitors.
- **Objective**: Explain the differences in visiting patterns and discuss potential reasons for these differences.

### C. Sentiment Analysis
- **Task**: Compare the overall sentiments expressed by customers about each theme park branch.
- **Objective**: Identify which theme park received the most positive sentiments.

### D. Service Sentiment Analysis
- **Task**: Identify the theme park branch that received the most positive sentiment regarding their "services."
- **Objective**: Highlight the branch with the highest customer satisfaction in terms of service quality.

### E. Customer Concerns and Interests
- **Task**: Analyze and identify the concerns or interests of customers when visiting the theme parks.
- **Objective**: Understand what aspects of the theme parks are most important to customers.

### F. Regional Differences in Concerns and Interests
- **Task**: Compare the differences in concerns and interests between visitors from the United States and the United Kingdom.
- **Objective**: Explain the potential reasons for these differences and how they reflect the distinct preferences of visitors from these regions.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab
